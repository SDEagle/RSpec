* Build in spec file now auto choose rspec build (Thanks @osrocha)
* Added feature and scenario snippets (Thanks @jaredmoody)
* "subject" and "let" now highlight correctly, words like "subjective" and "letter" are no longer half highlighted
* Saving new file with RSpec filetype no longer prompts with ".spec.rb", not it's ".rb"
* Added "create new module" command to command palette, planning to remove the key binding <ctrl/super+alt+n>
